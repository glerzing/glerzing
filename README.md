- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alain Le Noac'h, a software engineer. I'm currently interested by job opportunities, especially in Ireland.

### Professional experience
5 years of experience developing C++ software and Python tests for safety-critical equipments, including 4 years in Thales. I avoid getting into details here to be sure I don't share any sensitive information.

### Volunteer experience
Wikipedia [translator](https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sp%C3%A9cial:Contributions/Alenoach&target=Alenoach&offset=&limit=500) / [editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Alenoach) on AI safety topics.

Past experience with programming exercises on Euler Project (problems involving mathematics and programming, 205 problems solved) and [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/user/Zergling/) (CTFs involving cryptography and programming).

Contributed to [Tournesol](https://tournesol.app), a website that recommends high-quality YouTube videos, and collects data on people's ethical preferences :
- Backend development
- [Developed a search bar algorithm](https://github.com/tournesol-app/tournesol/pull/1039) integrated with PostgreSQL. It was hard to find the right design and syntax, but definitely a valuable experience in NLP and SQL.
- Coauthor of [Tournesol: Permissionless Collaborative Algorithmic Governance with Security Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01179), a paper establishing a fair and secure voting scheme notably using linear algebra and Bayesian statistics.
- [Tested multiple techniques for topic classification](https://github.com/tournesol-app/tournesol/issues/1468) on videos, such as lbl2vec, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and LLM prompt tuning.

Completed 14 [Kaggle tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) related to machine learning (each tutorial generally takes around 4 hours, here are the completion certificates : [Kaggle_certificates.zip](https://github.com/glerzing/glerzing/files/11657136/Kaggle_certificates.zip)). Followed the Center For AI safety's [ML safety course](https://course.mlsafety.org/).

[Integrated peft](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/pull/486) (parameter-efficient fine-tuning, e.g. Lora) in [trlx](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx), a Python library for fine-tuning large language models with reinforcement learning. This was a very interesting project for learning, which gave me some practical experience with LLMs, Hugging Face's transformers library, PyTorch, reinforcement learning, and distributed computing.

I currently want to help people understand what is going on inside neural networks. So I started to contribute to [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), an interpretability Python library using PyTorch that helps analyze the internals of transformer models. And I hope my future job will help me sharpen my skills in Machine Learning, PyTorch, Python and transformers so that I can continue to improve my efficiency.
